\beginsong{Art Is Dead}[by={Bo Burnham}]

\beginchorus
Art is dead
Art is dead
Art is dead
Art is dead
\endchorus
\beginverse
Entertainers like to seem complicated
But we're not complicated
I can explain it pretty easily
Have you ever been to a birthday party for children?
And one of the children won't stop screaming?
'Cause he's just a little attention-attractor
When he grows up to be a comic or actor

\endverse
\beginverse
He'll be rewarded for never maturing
For never understanding or learning
That every day can't be about him
"There's other people, you selfish asshole!"

\endverse
\beginverse
I must be psychotic, I must be demented
To think that I'm worthy of all this attention
Of all of this money you worked really hard for
I slept in late while you worked at the drug store
My drug's attention, I am an addict
But I get paid to indulge in my habit
It's all an illusion, I'm wearing makeup
I'm wearing makeup, makeup, makeup, makeup

\endverse
\beginverse
Art is dead
So, people think you're funny
How do we get those people's money?
I said, art is dead
We're rolling in dough while Carlin rolls in his grave
His grave
His grave

\endverse
\beginverse
The show has got a budget
The show has got a budget
And all the poor people way more deserving
Of the money won't budge it
'Cause I wanted my name in lights
When I could have fed a family of four
For forty fucking fortnights
Forty fucking fortnights

\endverse
\beginverse
I am an artist; please, God, forgive me
I am an artist; please, don't revere me
I am an artist; please, don't respect me
I am an artist; feel free to correct me

\endverse
\beginverse
A self-centered artist, self-obsessed artist
I am an artist, I am an artist
But I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, kid
And maybe I'll grow out of it

\endverse
