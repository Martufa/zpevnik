\begin{song}{Killing Me Softly}[by={N/A}]
\beginverse
\[Am7]I heard she \[Dsus2]sang a good song, \[Gmaj7]I heard she \[Csus2]had a style.
And so I came to see her and \[Em]listen for a \[Em7]while.
\[Am7]And there she \[D7]was this young girl, \[G]a stranger \[H7]to my eyes.

\endverse
\beginverse
\[Em7]Strumming my pain with her \[Am7]fingers,
\[D7]singing my life with her \[Gmaj7]words,
\[Em7]killing me softly with \[A]her song,
killing me \[D]softly with \[C]her song,
telling my \[G]whole life with \[Csus2]her words,
\[Fmaj]killing me softly with her \[E]song

\endverse
\beginverse
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt she found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that she would finish but she just kept right on.
\endverse
\beginverse
Strumming my pain with her fingers,
singing my life with her words,
killing me softly with her song,
killing me softly with her song,
telling my whole life with her words,
killing me softly with her song
\endverse
\beginverse
She sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
and then she looked right through me as if I wasn't there.
But she just came to singing, singing clear and strong.
\endverse
\beginverse
Strumming my pain with her fingers,
singing my life with her words,
killing me softly with her song,
killing me softly with her song,
telling my whole life with her words,
killing me softly with her song 
\endverse
\end{song}
