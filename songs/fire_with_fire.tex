\beginsong{Fire With Fire}[by={\normalsize AliceBand}]
\beginverse
\[Cm]I thought that fire with fire would burn the problem quicker
\[Cm]But all this good advice, his hair just grows back thicker
\[Cm]And if I take my own advice the worst just gets here quicker
\[Cm]So what's it all supposed to do
The fire eats fire and the fire's in \[Cm]you
\endverse

\beginchorus
And I have nothing here for y\[Ab]ou
All this water's gone and\[B] you, you've done nothing here for \[G]me
Except I know that I can't b\[Cm]reathe
And we were talkin all week\[Ab]end
I guess I'm mad because I \[Eb]am
And I've tried this all bef\[Fm]ore
Just in my he\[G]ad not in con\[Cm]trol
\endchorus

\beginverse
Which is w\[Ab]hy the music died
And we're l\[Fm]iving out our lives in this\[B] hope one day our liv\[G/H]es will straighten o\[Cm]ut
And we will \[Ab]leave town
And we'll get \[Fm]down to business now will someone te\[B]ll me w\[G/H]ho I \[Cm]am
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Cm]It's always been a little hard, I wish that you could meet her
\[Cm]This woman that you have become, you know that she's a keeper
\[Cm]Except you keep her under wraps in case someone should break her
\[Cm]It's dirty in this world, it's true
I wish I could and she does too
\endverse

And I have nothing here for y\[Ab]ou
All this water's gone and\[B] you, you've done nothing here for \[G]me

\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Cm]I believe the good wore out and pain does have its purpose
\[Cm]It seems a little silly now, that you would just desert us
\[Cm]I know that everything you do, things happen for a reason
\[Cm]But give something good, a sign, I need something to believe in
\endverse
