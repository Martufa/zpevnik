\begin{song}{Always Look on the Bright Side of Life}[by={Monty Python}]
\beginverse
Some \[Am]things in life are \[Adim7]bad, they can \[G]really make you \[G6]mad
\[Am]Other things just \[Adim7]make you swear and cu\[G]rse\[G6]
When you're \[Am]chewing on life's \[Adim7]gristle
Don't \[G]grumble, give a \[E7]whistle
And \[A7]this'll help things turn out for the \[D7]best
\endverse

\beginchorus
And \[G]always \[Em7]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of lif\[G]e\[Em7]\[Am]\[D7]
\[G]Always \[Em7]look on the \[Am]light \[D7]side of lif\[G]e\[Em7]\[Am]\[D7]
\endchorus

\beginverse
If \[Am]life seems jolly \[D7]rotten, there's \[G]something you've for\[Em7]gotten
and \[Am]that's to laugh and \[D7]smile and dance and \[G]sing\[G6]
When you're \[Am]feeling in the d\[D7]umps, d\[G]on't be silly ch\[E7]umps
Just \[A7]purse your lips and whistle - that's the \[D7]thing
\endverse

\beginchorus
And \[G]always \[Em7]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of lif\[G]e,   \[Em7]    come \[Am]on\[D7]
\[G]Always \[Em7]look on the \[Am]right \[D7]side of lif\[G]e\[Em7]\[Am]\[D7]
\endchorus

\beginverse
For \[Am]life is quite ab\[D7]surd and \[G]death's the final \[Em7]word
You must \[Am]always face the \[D7]curtain with a b\[G]ow\[G6]
For\[Am]get about your \[D7]sin - give the \[G]audience a g\[E7]rin
En\[A7]joy it - it's your last chance anyh\[D7]ow
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]Just be\[Em7]fore you \[Am]draw your \[D7]terminal brea\[G]th\[Em7]\[Am]\[D7]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]Life's a piece of s\[D7]hit, \[G]when you look at it\[Em7]
\[Am]Life's a laugh and \[D7]death's a joke, it's t\[G]rue\[G6]
You'll \[Am]see it's all a \[D7]show,
keep 'em \[G]laughing as you \[E7]go
Just re\[A7]member that the last laugh is on \[D7]you
\endverse

\beginchorus
And \[G]always \[Em7]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of lif\[G]e\[Em7]\[Am]\[D7]
\[G]Always \[Em7]look on the \[Am]right \[D7]side of lif\[G]e\[Em7]\[Am]\[D7]
\endchorus

\beginverse
(Come on guys, cheer up)
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]Always \[F#m7]look on the \[H&]bright \[E7]side of lif\[A]e\[F#m7]\[H&]\[E7]
\[A]Always \[F#m7]look on the \[H&]bright \[E7]side of lif\[A]e (Wo\[F#m7]rse thin\[H&]gs hap\[E7]pen at sea, you know?
